## Welcome to Latex Tutorial!

This site is modifaction version of [Learn Latex](https://learnlatex.org/en). All
data is taken from [Learn Latex](https://learnlatex.org/en) and modified according to
my personal choice. Although I liked [Learn Latex](https://learnlatex.org/en) documentation
but I do not think the information avialabe there is sufficient. I want to minimize the instruction
given there and want to add many more latex example code here. 

## How the examples work

To support your learning, the site includes lots of examples. In
[Lesson 2](en/lesson-02) we will talk about how you use LaTeX both online and
with a local installation on your PC. To get you started, we have set up
our examples so you can edit and run them in this website. We
have also linked them to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), one of the
most popular online LaTeX editing services. But don't worry, you can also
use the examples on your machine. You can read more about how to use the
examples in [the help page](en/help).

Our examples are based around using an up-to-date LaTeX installation. They
all work with both of our online demonstration systems, so if you get
errors with the examples we provide, you might want to check if your LaTeX
system is up-to-date.

## Going further

The focused lessons here are not meant to cover everything you'll ever need to
know about LaTeX; we want to give you enough to get started and to _understand_
examples and advice elsewhere. We cover getting more information in [the last
lesson](en/lesson-16), but it's worth saying now that getting access to a book
about LaTeX is still the  best way to learn the details. We've given some
recommendations in the last lesson.

Finally we offer a gallery of small examples showing
a range of different subject areas not covered in this introduction,
and different LaTeX packages in those areas.
